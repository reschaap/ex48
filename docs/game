        Include alternative wording
        Use the multiple choice answers as a starting point
    Determine which words need to be added to 'lexicon'
    Handle wrong input
        Display a message how to enter the correct input and give the player
        another chance to enter the input corectly
        
Flow
    'game' displays the description text of the current room than gives the 
    palyer a choice. The player can type in the answer. Using 'lexicon' and 
    'parser' the player's answer is then converted into a 'Sentence' object.
    This object contains the subject, verb and object of the answer. 
    The subject, verb and object are than compared to the expected combination
    of subjects, verbs and objects
    If the answer the player gave does not match. The player is asked to try
    to give another answer.
